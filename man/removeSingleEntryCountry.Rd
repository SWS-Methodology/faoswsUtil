\title{This function removes countries that has only one observation}
\usage{
removeSingleEntryCountry(data)
}

\item{data}{The data.table object containing the data.}
}

    observation are omitted from the original data.
}
\description{
TODO (Michael): The by key (param$byKey) should be extended, the
                criteria should be 1 observation per
                country/item/element combination.
}
\details{
NOTE (Michael): The application of the function is questionable. I
                would impute the series even if there is only one
                dataset. It is the best given the information set,
                and we should aim to improve the data collection.
